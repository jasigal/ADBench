# Loading and Running a PyTorch Model in OCaml

This tutorial follows the steps of the
[Loading a PyTorch Model in C++ tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html).

PyTorch models are commonly written and trained in Python. The trained model can then be
serialized in a [Torch Script](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) file.
The Torch Script file contains a description of the model architecture as well as
trained weights. This file can be loaded from OCaml to run inference for the saved
model.

In this tutorial this is illustrated using a ResNet-18 model that has been trained on the
ImageNet dataset. We start by loading and serializing the model using the Python api.
The resulting model file is later loaded from OCaml and run on some given image.

## Converting a Python PyTorch Model to Torch Script

There are various ways to create the Torch Script as detailed
in the original [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html).

Here we will use tracing. The following python script runs the
pre-trained ResNet-18 model on some random image and uses tracing to create
the Torch Script file based on this evaluation.

```python
import torch
import torchvision

model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()
example = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(model, example)
traced_script_module.save("model.pt")
```

Note that `model.eval()` is useful to ensure that the saved model is
in testing mode rather than in training mode. This has an impact on the
batch-norm layers.

The last line creates the `model.pt` Torch Script file which includes both the model
architecture and the trained weight values.

## Loading the Torch Script Model from OCaml

The `model.pt` file can then be loaded and executed from OCaml.
Create a `load_and_run.ml` file with the following content.

```ocaml
open Base
open Torch

let () =
  let model = Module.load "model.pt" in
  let image = Torch_vision.Imagenet.load_image "image.jpg" in
  Module.forward model [ image ]
  |> Tensor.softmax ~dim:(-1)
  |> Torch_vision.Imagenet.Classes.top ~k:5
  |> List.iter ~f:(fun (class_name, p) ->
      Stdio.printf "%s: %%.2f%%\n%!" class_name (100. *. p))
```

Let us have a closer look at what this code is doing. First
the model is loaded from the `model.pt` file.

```ocaml
  let model = Module.load "model.pt" in
```

Then an image is loaded from the `image.jpg` file and converted
to a tensor using ImageNet normalization.

```ocaml
  let image = Torch_vision.Imagenet.load_image "image.jpg" in
```

Finally we run the model on the image tensor.

```ocaml
  Module.forward model [ image ]
```

This results in a tensor of shape `1x1000` containing the logits
for the classification layer. `softmax` is used to convert these
into probabilities and `Classes.top` returns the top 5 classes
and the associated probabilities.

## Building and Executing the OCaml Script

An easy way to build OCaml code is to use the
[dune build system](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).

Dune reads the necessary metadata from `dune` files.
Create a `dune` file with the following content.

```
(executables
  (names load_and_run)
  (libraries torch torch_vision))
```

This instructs dune to build the `load_and_run.exe` executable
using `load_and_run.ml` with the specified libraries.
Running dune can be done with the following command.

```bash
dune build load_and_run.exe
```

Dune uses the `_build` directory to store the created binaries
as well as the build artifacts. The created binary can be found in
this directory or can be run directly using the command below.

can be downloaded from wikipedia.

```bash
dune exec load_and_run.exe model.pt image.jpg
```

This results in the OCaml code printing the top 5 predicted
labels as well as the attached probabilities.

```
tiger, Panthera tigris: 97.60%
tiger cat: 2.32%
zebra: 0.07%
tabby, tabby cat: 0.01%
jaguar, panther, Panthera onca, Felis onca: 0.01%
```
